<p> I've always wonder how time works or better yet how time began. In today's society everything is measured in time, but where did it all begin. most people believe in the big bang theory, others believe that time started in a religious way. Sometimes I wonder how the first people began to keep track of time.</p>
<p> It's believe that humans began keeping track of time around 12 to 15 thousand years ago. Back in those days they didn't have clocks, watches, or phones like we have in todays technological society. It makes you wonder if our time is right.
